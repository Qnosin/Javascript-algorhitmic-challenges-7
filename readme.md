## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #7
seventh exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

* Task
- Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
```
"In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an 
integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, 
it is the product of some integer with itself."
```
* Examples:
```
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

```
